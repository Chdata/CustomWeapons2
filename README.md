# Custom Weapons 2
Valve still not adding new weapons to TF2? No problem. Custom Weapons 2 allows you to create your own weapons and let your players use them.

Once you've installed the plugin and some weapons, all players have to do is say /custom, /cus or /c for the list of custom weapons for that class.

It's somewhat like Advanced Weaponiser, except the creation, modification, and selection of weapons is not limited to a certain group of people; it's up to whoever installs the plugin.

You can create your own weapons with unique stats, and share them with other servers using Custom Weapons 2. Apply any Valve attribute you'd like onto your weapon.

Valve attributes not unique enough? Create your own attributes sub-plugin with ease. Each custom attribute added allows for more and more unique weapons to be created with it!
